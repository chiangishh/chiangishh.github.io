  <p>We believe that by designing an application focused on promoting optimism, community, and credibility for supporters of the AAPI movement, we‚Äôll help reduce AAPI hate crimes and fear for victims.

<div id="this">

    <p>
        This will be accomplished through allyships with movements like Black Lives Matter to form a sense of community. Additionally, we‚Äôll promote events, provide visual updates of hate crimes via a map and live feed, and share credible resources that will spread awareness to protect the AAPI community. Finally, we will highlight the progress that has been made to increase positivity and reduce fear.</p>

<h2>To understand user pain points with the social movement, we created a Google form survey and interviewed individuals through Zoom.</h2>

<div class="challenges">
    <h2>identifying the challenges</h2>
    <p>We learned that AAPI supporters feel strongly about recent hate crimes against the community and want to spread awareness and decrease crime.</p>

    <p>Young supporters feel enraged for the AAPI community, while the older demographics are experiencing fear. We as UX Designers would like to help by creating an application designed to promote optimism while spreading awareness of the grave situation.</p>

    <h3>Did you know that 233,000 Asian-owned small businesses in the U.S. closed between February to April 2020, including half of the country's Chinese restaurants. Research cited by Restaurant Business Magazine showed "consumer prejudice and misperceptions" as factors.</h3>

    <h2>Wireframing and Lofi üë©‚Äçüî¨ üìê </h2>
    <p>We began our design process by sketching and creating a low fidelity mockup. These were the initial wireframes used during user testing!</p>
<img src="/Users/chian/Documents/2025/Portfolio/website code/extracurriculars/wireframe.png" alt="">
<p> 1. Do they care for event recaps?</p>
<p>2. Do they prefer dark or light UI and why?</p>
<img src="/Users/chian/Documents/2025/Portfolio/website code/extracurriculars/wireframe 2.png" alt="">
<p>We started off with a dark ui to match the website, however after user testing different color palettes, we decided with lighter UI. It aligned better with the positive and empowering theme. The new color palette was more empowering where it represented flesh tone. We also added brush strokes to multiple elements in our UI to create a sense of urgency to represent the importance of taking immediate action.</p>
